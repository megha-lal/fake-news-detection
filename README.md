# Fake News Detection

Develop an algorithm or model that can automatically identify and flag news articles, posts or videos as either authentic or fake. The objective is to create a reliable and efficient system that can help individuals and organizations to distinguish between real and fake news and promote the dissemination of accurate information.

The dataset contains a collection of articles from various news sources. The dataset consists of two main parts: a training set and a test set.

The training set contains 20,800 articles, with each article being labeled as either "Real" or "Fake". The articles were collected from various sources, including news websites, blogs, and social media. Reliable news is labelled as 0 and unreliable is labelled as 1.

The test set contains 5,200 articles, which are unlabelled and used for testing the models' performance.

The dataset is collected from kaggale.
